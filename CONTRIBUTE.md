# Contribute

Welcome to Kenya Map!

This is a pretty simple project. At the moment, there's no real need for other contributors - but, if you're interested, let me know what you'd like to do. I'd suggest [opening an issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/kenya-map/issues/new).

All work here conforms to the [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/). Please respect the Code. Thank you.
